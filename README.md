# DSA Code Repository - Java

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) code repository! 

This repository is dedicated to **daily uploads** of the codes I am practicing as part of my DSA journey using Java. Every day, I work on different problems related to data structures and algorithms, and I upload the solutions here for practice, learning, and reference.

In addition to coding exercises, I also include solutions for problems from **GeeksforGeeks** and **LeetCode** related to the course material I am currently working on. These problems align with key DSA concepts and help me further enhance my problem-solving skills.

## What is in this repository?

- **Daily Code Solutions**: I am solving various problems related to arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, searching, sorting, and more.
- **Java Solutions**: All solutions are written in Java to strengthen my programming skills and grasp of data structures and algorithms.
- **GeeksforGeeks Problems**: Solutions to selected GeeksforGeeks problems that are relevant to my current DSA learning path.
- **LeetCode Problems**: Solutions to LeetCode problems that help reinforce my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Daily Updates

- I **daily update** this repository by uploading new codes that I solve each day.
- Solutions include problems from both **GeeksforGeeks** and **LeetCode** related to the course material.
- These updates help me track my progress and keep improving my skills consistently.
